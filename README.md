# Tweaked iOS Apps

### Actively injecting requested tweaks into iOS apps and updating to latest versions.

You are able to sideload these with [AltStore](https://altstore.io/), [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or your preferred sideloading service. You also should be able to permasign these on jailed 15.0-15.1.1 devices using [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore).
Jailbroken devices should install the app from App Store and the tweak from it's repo due to the lack of a settings page of tweaks which support it and substitute/libhooker compatibility issues that may happen).  

All .ipas tested on an iPhone 12 running iOS 15.4.1.
