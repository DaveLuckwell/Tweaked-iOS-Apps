# Tweaked iOS Apps

### Actively injecting requested tweaks into iOS apps and updating to latest versions.

You are able to sideload these with [AltStore](https://altstore.io/), [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or your preferred sideloading service. 
You also should be able to permasign these on jailed 15.0-15.1.1 devices using [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore).
Jailbroken devices should install the app from App Store and the tweak from it's repo due to the lack of a settings page with tweaks which support it and substitute/libhooker compatibility issues that may happen.  

All .ipas tested on an iPhone 12 running iOS 15.4.1.

## Notes
All tweaks were injected using [Azule](https://github.com/Al4ise/Azule).

All tweaks were obtained within their GitHub repos or by fetching the .debs via their cydia repos using [cydownload](https://github.com/borishonman/cydownload).

Nothing besides the files within each tweak's folder were used to generate the .ipas. If you have any doubt about the content in them, rename the file to .zip, uncompress it and look for yourself.

Developers of these tweaks, if you don't want me to host an .ipa with your tweak injected, contact me and I'll delete it immediately.
