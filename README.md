# Tweaked iOS Apps

### Tweaks injected into sideloadeable iOS apps.

You are able to sideload these with [AltStore](https://altstore.io/), [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or your preferred sideloading service. 

You should also be able to permasign these on jailed 15.0-15.1.1 devices using [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore). _Some users are reporting issues permasigning .ipas made for sideloading, I´m looking into it and if necessary will be releasing separate .ipas to be used with TrollStore._

Jailbroken devices should install the app from App Store and the tweak from it's repo due to the lack of a settings page with tweaks which support it and substitute/libhooker compatibility issues that ~~may~~ probably will happen.


All .ipas tested on an iPhone 12 running iOS 15.4.1.

## Notes
**ALL CREDITS GOES TO THE DEVELOPERS OF THE TWEAKS, SUPPORT THEM.** The only thing I'm doing is injecting the tweaks into .ipas so that unexperienced users can sideload them easily.

Developers of these tweaks, if you don't want me to host an .ipa with your tweak injected, contact me and I'll delete it immediately.

All tweaks were injected using [Azule](https://github.com/Al4ise/Azule).

All tweaks were obtained within their GitHub repos or by fetching the .debs via their cydia repos using [cydownload](https://github.com/borishonman/cydownload).

Everything used to generate the injected .ipas are inside each tweak's folder. **Except from the decrypted .ipas**, which are required for proper tweak injection and sideloading on jailed devices. I will decrypt them by myself once I get access to a jailbroken device or an Apple Silicon Mac. For now, I have to get them from trusted sources like [Decrypted iOS IPA App Store](https://armconverter.com/decryptedappstore/us), [Decrypt IPA](https://ipa.decrypt.day) and [qnblackcat](https://github.com/qnblackcat/)´s [Decrypted-IPAs repo](https://github.com/qnblackcat/Decrypted-IPAs).
