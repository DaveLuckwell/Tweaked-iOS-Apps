# Tweaked iOS Apps

**Tweaks injected into iOS apps.** _(last update: 03/12/23)_

You can install these on jailed 14.0-15.4.1 devices using [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore).

You also can sideload these with [**Sideloadly**](https://sideloadly.io/), [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) or your preferred sideloading service. **Sideloadly is recommended.**

Installing these via TrollStore should make push notifications work on all apps. _and local song importing on Spotify_

Sideloading, you'll only get push notifications using a paid developer account. _not sure about local song importing on Spotify_

**All .ipas tested on an iPhone 12 running iOS 15.4.1. Installed via TrollStore and sideloaded via Sideloadly.**

# Notes

**ALL CREDITS GOES TO THE DEVELOPERS OF THE TWEAKS, SUPPORT THEM.** The only thing I'm doing is injecting the tweaks into .ipas so that unexperienced users can use them easily.

Developers of these tweaks, if you don't want me to host an .ipa with your tweak injected, contact me and I'll delete it immediately.

All tweaks were injected using [Azule](https://github.com/Al4ise/Azule), [Theos](https://theos.dev/) and [Theos Jailed](https://github.com/kabiroberai/theos-jailed).

All tweaks were obtained within their GitHub repos or by fetching .debs via their cydia repos using [cydownload](https://github.com/borishonman/cydownload).

Everything used to generate the injected .ipas is inside each tweak's folder. **Except from the decrypted .ipas**, which are required for proper tweak injection. I will decrypt them by myself once I get access to a jailbroken device or an Apple Silicon Mac. For the time being, I get them from [Decrypted iOS IPA App Store](https://armconverter.com/decryptedappstore/us), [Decrypt IPA](https://ipa.decrypt.day) and [qnblackcat](https://github.com/qnblackcat/)'s [Decrypted-IPAs repo](https://github.com/qnblackcat/Decrypted-IPAs).
